  quote: "Integrating NAPALM with NetBox has unlocked tremendous potential. We can click a button on the page and NAPALM will compare what it learns from a device to the data in NetBox, and we can immediately tell if an LLDP neighbor is missing or if a cable is out of place. It's a real force multiplier in network operations!"
