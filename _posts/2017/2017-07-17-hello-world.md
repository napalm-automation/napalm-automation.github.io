While the Napalm Automation project has been around for a couple of years, there hasn't been a good place to share information about the effort and to spread news about new features and ideas. It is time to fix that problem, so welcome to the new Napalm website!

As I write this the site is so new we're still playing with the bubblewrap. Currently there's not a lot of information available on the site, but it will continue to grow.

### What is Napalm?
If you are new to Napalm and wondering what it is, the best way to describe it is that; Napalm is an [open source](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm) Python library that provides a unified API against network devices from different vendors. If talking about Python, libraries and APIs makes you uncomfortable you can instead think of Napalm as a tool which can help you with network automation. Even if you don't know how to code yourself you can still use Napalm together with automation frameworks such as Ansible or Salt. And if you are familiar with Python you can write your own programs which uses Napalm to configure and gather information from your network.

### Community effort
As we were talking about launching this site [David]({{ site.url }}/dbarrosop/) asked me to write this Hello World post as an introduction. Given that he created entire Napalm project and, aside from a few commits, I only assembled the website it felt a bit weird for me. At first I thought that it would be wrong that I and not he should the write first post. After thinking about it some more I reconsidered. While the project started with David Barroso and Elisa Jasinska things have changed since Napalm was first launched. Today Napalm is a community effort with a lot of contributors which all help to evolve the project. The [community page]({{ site.url }}/community/) has more details about how you could help, it doesn't have to be writing code.
