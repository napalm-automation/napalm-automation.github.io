description: "About David Barroso"

Although my current title is Senior Software Developer I am a Network Engineer at heart that also happens to love Systems and basically anything you can manipulate into doing things for you without too much arguing (which immediately qualifies robots and dogs but disqualifies humans and cats. Although I also like cats :P)

I am one of the cocreators of NAPALM and I believe in open-source. I take great pride into replacing proprietary software with open-source and cutting ties with vendors who are often slow to react and usually introduce on each release more problems than solutions.

I also happen to [blog](https://www.dravetech.com) every now on then about things like automation and open-source.
