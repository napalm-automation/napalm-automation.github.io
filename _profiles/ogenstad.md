I'm Patrick. I work as a network consultant in Sweden and really like the direction that the industry is going with more focus on automation and the need to manage networks in a better way.

Aside from being a fantastic piece of software what I like about this project is the [Napalm community]({{ site.url }}/community/) which is filled with great people. While I haven't contributed a lot of code to the project I try to pitch in when I can or when there is some feature that I need.

I enjoy working on open source projects and helping others who are interested in automation. My home on the internet is [Networklore](https://networklore.com/), where I sometimes try to write a few blog posts.
