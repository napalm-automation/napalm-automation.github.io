description: "About Mircea Ulinic"
---
Mircea is a software engineer with a great passion for the telecom world,
in particular for networking. He knows how a manycore processor works (and
hands-on experience during his parallel computing research at EPFL),
understands how a 4G network works, but he didn't have the chance yet to
implement sudowires in a real network yet. Also, loves maths, physics and all
the things everyone hates.

He has massively contributed to the growth of NAPALM and has integrated it
in Salt, making vendor-agnostic event-driven network-automation and
orchestration easier. Now, he's also a maintainer and hopes to help everyone
as much as possible.

Sometimes he [blogs](https://mirceaulinic.net/) about networking, automation,
how network vendors suck, but soon perhaps he'll find some more time to write
about many other stuff, not necessarily networking-related only (coz life
is so much more than that).
